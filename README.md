# Pychatbot Tacca Oudin.
> ###### 2023-L1 EFREI Tacca Timothée, Oudin Julien


This tool allows users to analyze speeches of different presidents.

This python chat-bot gives you the ability to associate names with first names, list available presidential names, clean text files, remove punctuation and accents, calculate TF-IDF scores, and perform various analyzes of speeches.

Be sure to have a folder with .txt files to treat, we recommand the name 'speeches' but you can use any other name !
We also recommand you to use the name 'cleaned' for the name of the folder where the files will be treated, but any other name should work !

Once the “main.py” is launched, you have two choices, on one hand a “chat-bot” mode allowing you to ask questions. There is just a minimalistic display. On the other hand there is a detailed grid describing which functions you can test. Once chosen, potential inputs of the question are asked and the result appears.

## Requirements

We advise you to use the latest version of python, as no module installation is required for the program to work properly. 

## Download.

First, download the filethrough our github project

![guide_1](https://github.com/timotheetacca/pychatbot-tacca-oudin-int2/assets/66522009/da603e89-24a9-46bd-9b94-2df5fcd4d3f9)


Then, ensure you have text files in a directory called `speeches`. We already included presidential nominations in this document. If you include more documents, some functions may stop working ⚠

## Usage.

You should then be able to run the `main.py` file. If this is the first time you've run the program, the code should ask you for information about the location of the backup files (you can change this later). Next, you'll have a choice between 'chat-mode' and 'debug mode'. Press '0' if you're entering debug mode, to test the project's various functions. Otherwise, press 'Enter' to enter chat mode, where you can chat with our robot.

![chat-mode](https://github.com/timotheetacca/pychatbot-tacca-oudin-int2/assets/66522009/55061103-c65d-4af1-8c55-df11873dbc6c)

If you wish to adjust the directory paths in function calls to suit your specific configuration, simply re-use the function and press '0' to change directories. 

![change_directories](https://github.com/timotheetacca/pychatbot-tacca-oudin-int2/assets/66522009/ad7b38c1-143a-4358-9f60-6c4ad3192285)

You can stop the program by typing 'stop' at any time, whatever your program execution mode (as long as you're not changing directories).
If you choose 'debug' mode, you can get a list of available commands by typing 'help'. Please note that some functions require prerequisites ⚠
